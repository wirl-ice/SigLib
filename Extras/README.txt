In this version... 

Did some snooping around and made 'test.py' to circumvent lots of siglib hoopla to get to the bottom of things
Made noise.py to test Shawn Gong Spline vs my own.  They agree to the 6th decimal place so I am going to say my way is fine. Will delete Gong's Spline for next version. 
Started to replace the print statements with logging - works but not so much in parallel mode and logging is only Error level.
